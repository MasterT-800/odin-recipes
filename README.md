Odin Project: Recipes in the foundations course was a great way to solidify my understanding of basic html concepts and the git process through the creation of a simple food recipe website. Concepts used in the site creation were boilerplate html setup, the use of heading tags, the linking of pages through anchor tags, the embeding of images, and the use of lists through unordered and ordered list tags. The biggest takeaway from this simple project however was the use of git throughout. I made commits early and often with meaningful concise messages and ultimately pushed to github. These are foundational skills for working in a team setting.
