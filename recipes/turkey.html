    </p>    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (18 pound) whole turkey</li>
        <li>8 cups prepared stuffing</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ quarts turkey stock, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the turkey:</strong> Remove the turkey neck and giblets. Pat the turkey dry with paper towels, then place it (breast-side up) on a rack in a roasting pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Stuff and season the turkey:</strong> Fill the cavity with stuffing. Rub the skin with butter, then season with salt and pepper. Pour two cups of stock into the roasting pan and loosely tent the turkey with foil.</li>
        <li><strong>Roast the turkey:</strong> Roast, basting with stock every 30 minutes, for about two and half hours. Add more stock as the drippings evaporate. Remove the foil and continue roasting until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees F.</li>
    </ol>
